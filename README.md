# Welcome to Spotisize!

*Spotisize is still currently in development*

Spotisize is a project dedicated to visualizing the music that makes your world, or rather galaxy, go 'round. On the Spotisize website, you can see your 
favourite artists and songs come to life as interactive bubbles scaled based on your listening trends. We are excited to add a lot of additional features
before our complete launch so stay tuned!
